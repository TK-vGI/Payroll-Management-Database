# Stage 2/4: Extra credit
## Description
Employees can work in the same department, but their pay may differ. The daily amount is determined by  
their hourly rate and total work hours; a working shift is eight hours, so there are 250 work days a typical  
year with an additional ten days of paid annual leave.

Sometimes, an employee must work beyond the standard hours to accomplish a task quickly. Overtime rates  
are 50 percent above standard. The maximum overtime pay is 6000 annually to encourage a healthy work-life balance.  
Employees are not penalized when they exceed this rate; they are not paid more. Part-time employee work hours  
do not exceed the standard hours and do not qualify for overtime pay.

You have been tasked with finding a simple way to retrieve an employee's pay information from their time log.  
You have been provided with the time log of the following employees:  

| Full names    | Hours worked |
|---------------|--------------|
| Philip Wilson | 2160         |
| Daisy Diamond | 2100         |

## Objectives
1. Create the procedure called `EmployeeTotalPay` that takes in `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_hours`, `normal_hours`,   
   `overtime_rate`, `max_overtime_pay`, and outputs `total_pay`.
2. Output the total pay for `Philip Wilson` and `Daisy Diamond`.

HINT: create a function that uses `IF-ELSEIF-ELSE` to calculate overtime pay for an employee.
