# Stage 3/4: Taxes
## Description
Paying taxes is an important responsibility. Income taxes are progressive. The amount of taxes each employee pays  
varies based on their hourly rate, overtime pay, and income.

The progressive tax structure is shown in the following table:

| Tax rate | Taxable income bracket | Tax owed                                     |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 10%      | $0 — 11,000            | 10% of taxable income                        |
| 12%      | $11,001 — 44,725       | $1,100 + 12% of the amount over 11,000       |
| 22%      | $44,726 — 95,375       | $5,147 + 22% of the amount over 44,725       |
| 24%      | $95,376 — 182,100      | $16,290 + 24% of the amount over 95,375      |
| 32%      | $182,101 — 231,250     | $37,104 + 32% of the amount over 182,100     |
| 35%      | $231,251 — 578,125     | $52,832 + 35% of the amount over 231,250     |
| 37%      | $578,126 or more       | $174,238.25 + 37% of the amount over 578,125 |

To calculate an employee's tax owed, determine their total pay, which is also their taxable income assuming  
no other deductibles. Identify the applicable tax bracket and calculate the tax owed.  
Develop an efficient method for determining tax owed by any employee.
