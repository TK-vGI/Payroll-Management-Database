# Stage 1/4: Meet the Colleagues
## Description
One of the most common operations on the database is to get a list of employees in a particular department.  
Write the query to get this information from scratch whenever needed. As the number of departments in the database grows,  
this will take more time and effort.  
You have been tasked to develop a more efficient way to retrieve this information from the database.

## Objectives
- Create a procedure called `GetEmployeesByDept` that returns the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `job_title`  
  for all employees in a given department.
- The output of the procedure is **ordered by** their `first_name`.
- **Call** the procedure for the ` "Office of Finance" ` department.

## Explanation of the database
You have a payroll management database with the following layout:
